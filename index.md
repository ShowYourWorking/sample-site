## Why ShowYourWorking?

 {{ site.software_name }} allows groups to manage and search their data securely. A simple upload function allows users to import details in a variety of standard formats. Each item is then given a unique identifier, validated and recorded. Built in security and configuration features mean you define who has access to your project to create, view and update the information, as well as what information is needed as a minimum for each item. The {{ site.software_name }} team can provide curation support to ensure data is recorded consistently. The web-based system provides access from any device, giving flexible access to information about, for example, materials in your lab.

A sophisticated search function means you can be confident of getting back all relevant information about the material you are looking for â€“ whether compound, antibody, plasmid or peptide.
