title: Coding standards
---

Coding standards are useful because they can help ensure that source
code is readable. Readable code is useful not only for the current {{
site.project_name }} developers if they need to modify or extend their
code at a later date, but also for other developers who wish to modify
or extend {{ site.project_name }}. Coding standards are valuable in
collaborative projects, such as {{ site.project_name }}, as they
recognise that the code belongs to the project as a whole, not any
individual developer, and a common look-and-feel to the code helps
foster collective ownership and the idea that any developer can work
on any part of the code. 

If you commit code that does not follow these conventions, you are
responsible for also fixing your own code.
