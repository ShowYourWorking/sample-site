## How to get help

If you experience a problem when using {{ site.project_name }}, then:

* Check the user documentation and release notes for your release.
* Search {{ site.mailing_list }} [archive]({{ site.mailing_list_archive }}).
* Search our [issue tracker]({{ site.issue_tracker}} ) for
  known problems and bugs, both open and fixed.  

If you cannot find a solution, then you can do one of:

* E-mail {{ site.mailing_list }} with your request.
* Create a [new issue]({{ site.issue_tracker_new_issue }})

See [How to ask for help](#how-to-ask-for-help), below, for advice on
what information you should provide.

### What is and is not supported

* All releases with a version number are supported.

### What support we offer

The {{ site.project_name }} team consists of members in a number of
organisations who work on a number of projects, and may be very
busy. {{ site.project_name }}'s support relies on the goodwill of
these members and organisations. Our support is 'best effort' (i.e.,
we'll do the best we can, given our other commitments).

## How to ask for help

* Submit only one request per report.
* State your operating system and version.
* State your {{ site.project_name }} version:
  - If you are using a source code release then give the version
    number of that release. 
* Provide any error messages and exceptions that you see. 
  - If providing exceptions then provide these exactly as displayed in
    a terminal window. 
  - Do *not* provide a simple textual summary like 'It threw an
    error'. 
* If using any plotting tools or a graphical package and, if you think
  it would help, then send a copy of your display: 
  - Under Ubuntu, use the Print Screen key to save an image of your
    display into your home directory as a .png file. 
* If possible, provide a recipe for repeating the bug.
* Provide any other information you think will help.
* Clearly separate fact from speculation.

Requests of the form 'I used {{ site.project_name }} and am stuck' are
not helpful to either you or us and people may suspect that you are
just a spammer or time waster. 

No bug is too trivial to report - small bugs may hide big bugs.
