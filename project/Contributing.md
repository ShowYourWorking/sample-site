## Features, enhancements or bug fixes

Before you submit a feature, enhancement or bug fix, make sure that:

* Your code confirms to the {{ site.software_name }} [coding
  standards](../developer/CodingStandards.html). 
* You have written automated tests (either new tests, or updates to
  existing tests) to test your feature or bug fix.
* You have list of steps required to test your feature.
* You have a list of changes to required to the documentation that are
  incurred by your feature or bug fix.

EITHER e-mail us at {{ site.mailing_list }} or {{ site.email }}. Include:

* EITHER a `.tar.gz` file or `.zip file` with your code.
* OR a patch file created using the Linux/UNIX `diff` command.  
* If you modified a source code release then give the version
  number of that release. 
* If you modified a version from Subversion then give the
  revision you modified:

~~~
$ svn info
~~~

  - If you are using a version from Git then give the commit hash
    of the version you modified (if you have commited any local
    changes to your Git repository then give the commit hash for
    the commit prior to your local changes):

~~~
$ git log
~~~

OR submit a pull request against the *gh-pages* branch of 
{{ site.code_repository }}.

For Subversion, we will put your contribution into a branch of the
repository.

We will check that your code compiles, that your code conforms to the 
{{ site.software_name }} coding standards, and that your tests
pass. We will also review your code. We will run though the list of
steps to test your feature and validate any documentation you
provide. If there are issues, we'll work with you to resolve these.

{{ site.software_name }} trunk and add you to our
