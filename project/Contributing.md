## Features, enhancements or bug fixes

Make sure that:

* Your code confirms to the {{ site.project_name }} [coding
  standards](../developer/CodingStandards.html). 
* You complement your code with automated tests (either new tests, or
  updates to existing tests) if possible.

E-mail us at {{ site.mailing_list }} or {{ site.email }}. Include:

* Either, a `.tar.gz` file or `.zip file` with your code
* Or, a patch file created using the Linux/UNIX `diff` command.  
* Or, submit a pull request against the *gh-pages* branch of 
  {{ site.code_repository }}.
* If you used a release then give the version number of that release.
* A list of steps required to test your feature.
* Changes or extensions to the user documentation that your feature
  needs.

We will put your contribution into a branch of the repository
repository and check that it compiles and that your code conforms to
the {{ site.project_name }} coding standards.

We will then run though the list of steps to test your feature and
validate any documentation you provide.

If there are issues, we'll work with you to resolve these. 

Once complete, we will merge your code into the {{ site.project_name
}} trunk and add you to our contributors in our documentation.
